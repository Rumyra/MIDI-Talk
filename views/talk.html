            <p>Hi everyone, my names Ruth - you can find me on the interwebs as rumyra.</p>
            <p>I've given up on job titles - I've had a lot of them and right at this minute I am...</p>
            <p>This is a url - this will be important, so you might want to visit it, I'll keep it on the screen so you can see it. If you have newest chrome on latest ios or marshmallow I also have it on my physical web token, so it should just be alerted in your phone settings - if you have no idea what I'm talking about - come and talk to me later and I'll explain :)</p>

            <p>So today I want to talk to you about something completely different -  something that you may or may not know anything about, regardless I hope it's something that you will leave this talk knowing a lot more about and full of inspiration to use.</p>

            <p>OK OK rule number one....</p>
            <p>This is not MIDI. But you all knew that right? MIDI is not digital audio - so those sounds you hear, they can't be MIDI!</p>

          <h2>It's OK</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>It's ok if you did think this was MIDI - back in the 80s when MIDI came about computer generated audio sounded like this and because they are intrinsically linked, you can be forgiven for the permanent association</p>
            <p>It's a common misconception and to understand that conception we have to understand MIDI - so here goes</p>

          <p class="fragment fade-in">Define data protocol</p>
          <p class="fragment fade-in">Industry experts in 1983</p>
          <p class="fragment fade-in">MIDI Manufacturers Association</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>So it's a technical specification - just like anything else. Made to define a data protocol so digital instruments & equipment could be compatible and talk to each other. Industry experts got together in 1982 and put it together in 1983.</p>
            <p>Think of the MMA like the W3C - it's a bunch of industry experts, with an invested interest in making a spec that suits everyones needs. Right. Simples.</p>
            <p>It all came about because of the rise of digital instruments - synthesizers, sequencers, digital keyboards etc...</p>

          <h2>There's lots to it</h2>
          <p class="fragment fade-in">General MIDI Spec</p>
          <p class="fragment fade-in">MIDI file format</p>
          <p class="fragment fade-in">Connector specification (DIN)</p>
          <p class="fragment fade-in">Plenty of extensions to the original spec which surpass music</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Before I get into specs I want to look at instruments/controllers.</p>

        <section data-background="public/media/midiConts.jpg">
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>These are just some examples of MIDI instruments.</p>
            <p>Top: Keyboard, synth, drum kit - also drum machines. You can also get things like guitar pedals, clarinet/sax type thing.</p>
            <p><b>One thing to bear in mind</b> MIDI used to be expensive - the digitals intruments & controllers themselves ran into the hundreds if not thousands of pounds and DIN connectors were the data connectors of choice. This dictated in the computer world - expensive sound cards.</p>
            <p>Bottom: Examples of basic controller. Launchpad (one first USB) - next two similar price AKAI LPD8 & Korg NanoPad2. Last icon iDJ</p>
            <p>You can see why there's the MMA, making sure all the different manufacturers stay in line with the protocol</p>            
            <p>Why is any of this relevant to you? Well we have access to this, in the lovely form of a web MIDI api</p>

          <p class="fragment fade-in">The most common spec</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>So let's look at General MIDI - the main spec, the one that you've seen and most likely to come across.</p>
            <p>One was the first version and was expanded to 2 in 1999 a bit like the jump from HTML4 -> 5 just gave you more shiny.</p>

          <h2>Core of General MIDI: Messages</h2>

          <p class="fragment fade-in">Channel Messages & System Messages</p>

          <p class="fragment fade-in">Channel messages transmitted on individual channels - depict note on/off, pressure, program change etc...</p>

          <p class="fragment fade-in">System messages are system wide - timing signals, start, continue & stop, system reset etc...</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>And with that in mind - because that all makes so much sense...</p>
            <p>Let's put it into context - we're going to focus on channel message</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>the first byte 144 is the message type and channel, 144 is 90 in hex and the 9 says it's a 'Note on' message and the 0 is the channel number.  
A 'Note on' message has two data bytes, the first is the 'key number' which I'm guessing is the note number, so 60 would be C
the second is 'note on velocity' and this has a value of 100, (I'm guessing this means the rate at which the note is turned on)</p>
