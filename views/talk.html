            <p>I came here today to talk to you about MIDI. It seems a strange topic, but one of the reasons I wanted to come and talk about it is to address a common misconception about MIDI, not just within the realms as what we do as developers but also in the wider world.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>That “music” you hear, that’s not "MIDI". You can be forgiven for thinking it is and it was probably made with a piece of software that was MIDI enabled. But it’s not, the sounds you hear are digital audio.</p>

            <p>But the key, the bit that’s really MIDI and really interesting is this bit “Digital Interface”. MIDI is a digital interface, at it’s basic it’s a data protocol for MIDI enabled hardware & software to be compatible with other MIDI enabled hardware & software.</p>

            <p>The first MIDI specs - because it is a bunch of technical specifications, came about in 1983, after a bunch of industry experts, we’re talking music hardware manufacturers, other renowned industry experts, got together after the rise of analogue and digital instruments in the 70’s - we’re talking synthesisers and such - and decided it would be good to have a common standard for all these instruments to talk to each other. And be bought into recording studios etc and be able to be plugged into recording equipment and be able to be recorded etc…</p>
            <p>Especially with the digital equipment you can understand the frustrations with this not being possible. So they formed the MMA - MIDI Manufacturers Association - the first MIDI specs involved A General MIDI Spec - which now has a lot more elements, more about this is a sec</p>

            <p>So I’m going to start with General MIDI - 1 was updated to 2 in the 90s. It’s basically just the jump from html4 to html5 - there was better hardware, better software, they added more to the spec. There is also a GM Light spec for ‘low powered mobile devices’ (pic of old handset) I’m pretty sure the phones in your hands can run GM2 we’re good :)</p>

          <p class="fragment fade-in">General MIDI: Channel Messages & System Messages</p>

          <p class="fragment fade-in">Channel messages: Voice messages & Mode messages</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>The spec comes can be grouped into two distinct parts. Channels and system level and because it’s a data protocol it’s just specs for messages - data messages.</p>
            <p>There are two types of channel messages - voice and mode. Voice messages are sent over voice channels and mode messages are sent over an instruments basic channel.</p>
            <p>The channels part of the general MIDI spec describes what you’ve just seen - it’s about note on, note off, velocity (how hard you press), and which frequency is playing, which note, C, D, E etc…</p>

          <p>Hex data</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Now this is the data that the web MIDI api passes back to us when a MIDI device is plugged in. So let's take a look at the code.</p>
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Web MIDI API</h2>
          <pre><code data-trim>navigator.requestMIDIAccess({ sysex: false }).then(onMIDISuccess, onMIDIFailure);

function onMIDISuccess(midiControl) {
  var MIDI = midiControl;
  MIDI.inputs.forEach(function (input) {
    console.log(input.onmidimessage.data)
  }
}
          </code></pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>You make sure it’s avail, listen for attached device, when plugged in you can receive these afore mentioned messages. All I’m doing here is logging those messages - you can do whatever you want with them. Notice the sysex false - this is related to system messages and I will get back to that in a moment.</p>
            <p>Now there’s a window of opportunity - there’s plenty of stuff we can start coding with that!</p>
            <p>But what are these values?</p>

          <h2>[144, 60, 100]</h2>
          <p class="fragment fade-in">[Message type (Note on) & Channel, Note, Velocity/Pressure]</p>
          <h2 class="fragment fade-in">[128, 60, 64]</h2>
          <p class="fragment fade-in">[Message type (Note off), Note, Velocity/pressure]</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>the first byte 144 is the message type and channel, 144 is 90 in hex and the 9 says it's a 'Note on' message and the 0 is the channel number. A 'Note on' message has two data bytes, the first is the 'key number' which I'm guessing is the note number, so 60 would be C the second is 'note on velocity' and this has a value of 100, (I'm guessing this means the rate at which the note is turned on)</p>

            <p>The system messages part of the GM spec deals with overriding system messages. These include System Common messages, System Real-time messages and System Exclusive messages.</p>
            <p>The system exclusive messages cover loading and saving patch or instrument information. So for instance if you want to save the state of a piece of hardware, you can ‘dump’ the information, save it and retrieve it later. It also includes manufacturer, product and device information.</p>
            <p>Only part in the Web spec. There’s lots of part of MIDI specs, we’ve taken the channel message and system exclusive messages part of the General MIDI spec and we have the bulk of the whole Web MIDI spec.</p>

            <p>And what about starting, stopping, continuing - this timing - this is important in MIDI. MIDI has it's own Time Code as part of the spec. The recording and playback equipment - we’ve only really delay with sound and instrument messages - this is all really still important.</p>

            <p>Now you noticed that - that latency - that’s the web right. I could have thought about setting them all off at a global time - but that depends on your devices all being set to the same global time.</p>

This came about to allow “MIDI systems to communicate with and control … audio recording and production systems”. Messages protocols include simple play, pause, stop, record to more complex time code based recorders and sequencers.</p>

Soledad - supersede - is talking about this. We have a Web API to cover this, it can be separated out from the Web MIDI spec.</p>
            <p>The Web MIDI API is design as such so it is kept low level and not in anyway complicated - there’s really good reasons for this. There’s a billion bits of MIDI hardware out there, to start adding more ‘features’ could complicate matters - at the moment, you can plug in anything midi enabled and although you might start receiving different values, you’re good to go.</p>

            <p>I'm just gonna read stright from the spec for this one</p>
            <p>This specification defines a way for MIDI to be used for control of visual presentation devices or systems. MIDI has expanded far beyond its original intention of being a control language for musical instruments. The robust nature of MIDI and wide support makes MIDI a suitable control system for visual performance or presentation devices.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, video has become a common component of musical performances in many venues. It makes sense to use MIDI as a way to tie musical performance to visual performance.</p>
            <p>When performing on a MIDI Visual Control compatible MIDI musical instrument, not only can sound be controlled, but images can be controlled as well. As a result, MIDI Visual Control makes it possible to create visual effects that are synchronized with a musical performance.</p>

            <p>I came here to talk to you about MIDI - when really secretly I was talking to you about specifications. How they’re important - how a something that’s been around for 30 years is still going strong and is still relevant - much like what we do with our web work. Just get a bunch of enthusiastic, clever, people together and you *will* create something that evolves to start includinging things you would never thinl of. Maing it all the more substantial and long lasting.</p>
